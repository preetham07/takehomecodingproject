# Take Home Coding Project:

## Assumptions

1. Assume 16px base font size
2. Nav bar color is #634A8F
3. All data needed to complete exercise is located in /utils/const.js

## Directions:

You are starting a new project and the first task is to create
the navigation bar, home page, and second page. The navigation will be
shared throughout all views in the app and fixed to the top of the page.

Recreate the comps as closely as possible using React and the
styling framework of your choice. All measurements must
be accurate and for parts of the comp where direction is
not given try to get close. The nav bar needs to be fixed to
the top of the screen so that it remains with the user as
they scroll.

For the second page, use the Pokemon API to pull in a Pokemon
and center it on one colored rectangle. The API looks like this:

`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/123/`

Docs: https://pokeapi.co/

Feel free to change up the Pokemon! The image is located in the `sprites`
object under `front_default`.

## What we're looking for:

- Clean code
- Nice component architecture
- Nice styles (written in any way you choose)
- Consistency with the comp provided
- Vanilla CSS - No CSS libraries like Bootstrap!
- Everything should work in the latest version of Chrome

## Extra credit (but not required):

- Responsive
- Tests
- Accessibility and Aria stuff
- Transitions and animations
- Using Hooks or any new React features
- IE11 support

Please send the link to your Codesandbox project to your recruiter for
us to review. Make sure we have permissions to view.
